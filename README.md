Simple CNN Models in Terms of Size and Computational Complexity for Classification On Medical Images

## Description
Millions of imaging procedures are being done worldwide every week for diagnostic purposes which needs expertise knowledge for interpretation. But according to the world health organization(WHO), there is a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, globally.

Over the past few years, there have been few breakthroughs achieved in medical imaging using Deep Learning. 

Medical datasets are different from natural image datasets in many aspects. For instance, medical datasets are usually quite small consisting of few dozens to thousands of observations compared to the 1.2 million observations used on ImageNet. Most problems consist of predicting a few classes (typical 2) and not 1000 classes like ImageNet. Here are a few questions we are trying to answer.

Can a model with 50 million parameters or more be learned with 500 hundred points? 
Is it necessary to use over parameterized architectures that are harder to train for simpler problems?
